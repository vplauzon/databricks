# Data Frames

Quick POC on Data frames.

Data is taken from http://bioinfo.uib.es/~joemiro/marvel.html.  It is copied over here to make sure the code of the notebook will work.

The following article explains the POC:  http://vincentlauzon.com/2018/01/24/azure-databricks-spark-sql-data-frames/.

The iPython [notebook](sql-notebook.ipynb) can be visualized here on GitHub.
